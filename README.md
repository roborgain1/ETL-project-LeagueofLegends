## *Background:* 
### The rankings used in League of Legends (LoL) from lowest-tier to highest-tier include: Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Master. The majority of LoL players find themselves in the lower tiers, with the higher tiers having a significantly lower volume of players. Each champion can fill one of five roles per game, which include: Top, Jungle, Mid, Bottom/AD Carry, and Support. The goal of this project was to compare the win-rates of specific champions and their roles based on player ranking.

## *Extraction:*
### - HTML data was scraped from two Leauge of Legends statistics websites using Beautiful Soup and Splinter with Jupyter Notebook.
    
## *Transformation:*
### - Pandas was used to create three dataframes to store champion data from different rankings (iron and above, platinum and above, and master tier).
### - Python was used to iterate through specific elements in the extracted Soup and to append chosen values to their previously created dataframe.
### - The dataframes were cleaned by dropping unncecessary columns, renaming/reordering columns, and sorted based on win-rates in descending order.
### - The three dataframes initially created were concatenated to a final dataframe with mixed rankings, sorted by win-rate, in order to compare champion win-rates between different league rankings
### - All dataframes were saved in csv's for optional usage and storage.
    
## *Loading:*
### - pgAdmin4 was used with relational database postgreSQL to create a schema or table called league_winrates using the same columns contained in the concatenated_csv.csv and final dataframe created.
### - sqlAlchemy was used to connect jupyter notebook to the table created with postgreSQL in pgAdmin's database and Pandas was used to load the dataframe in.

## *Conclusion:*
### postgreSQL was chosen to easily and quickly view/scroll through the 541 rows of data in the league_winrates table, as well as having high flexibility in selecting what data to observe in order to learn from the statistics. The Master tier contained the highest win-rates by far, but also the lowest win-rates, giving it the highest variation. The data may be skewed with more variance due to the smaller volume of players at higher rankings and thus a smaller sample. The champion Rumble, for example, was highly successful when played in the Master tier with a win-rate of 66.7% in the Top lane, while only having a win-rate of 48.7% in the Top lane when including Iron and above player statistics. This suggests that the skill cap on Rumble is high meaning those who master the champion in higher skill tiers are able to set themselves above the rest, while lower tier players have difficulty finding success. This data can be utilized by players who want to know what champions have the most success in the tier that they are currently playing in.
